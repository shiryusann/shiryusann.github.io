Welcome to my personal page. My name is Zilong /tsìlɔ́ŋ/ Li /lì/. I am interested in natural langauge processing and computational linguistics. I especially focus on human factors (such as human knowledge and human preference) and formal/symbolic methods in natural language processing. As a person with experience of humanities education, I am also interested in discussing philosophy, world history and Japnese.

Education
======
- M.S. in Computational Linguistics, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA, Aug 2023 - May 2025
- B.S. education (non-degree) in Data Science, China Agricultural University, China, Sept 2022 - June 2023
- B.A. in Japanese and B.A. in History, Nankai University, China, Sept 2018 - June 2022

Research Interest
=======
- **Computational Linguistics** formal methods/discrete mathematics (such as automaton and first order logic) in computational linguistics, language annotation, low resource methods in natural language processing
- **Large Language Model Post-training** language model reasoning methods over symbolic representations, aligning large language models with human values and domain specific knowledge
- **Eduational Technology** multimodal analysis, student behavior evaluation, education supporting technologies

Research Experience
=======
Student researcher in NSF National AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming at University of colorado, Boulder, July 2024 - July 2025
