Welcome to my personal page. My name is Zilong /tsìlɔ́ŋ/ Li /lì/. I am interested in natural langauge processing and computational linguistics. I especially focus on human factors (such as human knowledge and human preference) and formal/symbolic methods in natural language processing. As a person with experience of humanities education, I am also interested in discussing philosophy, world history and Japnese.

Education
======
- M.S. in Computational Linguistics, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA, Aug 2023 - May 2025
- B.S. education (non-degree) in Data Science, China Agricultural University, China, Sept 2022 - June 2023
- B.A. in Japanese and B.A. in History, Nankai University, China, Sept 2018 - June 2022

Research Interest
=======
- **Computational Linguistics** formal methods/discrete mathematics (such as automaton and first order logic) in computational linguistics, language annotation, low resource methods in natural language processing
- **Large Language Model Post-training** language model reasoning methods over symbolic representations, aligning large language models with human values and domain specific knowledge
- **Eduational Technology** multimodal analysis, student behavior evaluation, education supporting technologies

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
