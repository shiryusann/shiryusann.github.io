Welcome to my personal page. My name is Zilong /tsìlɔ́ŋ/ Li /lì/. I am interested in natural langauge processing and computational linguistics. I especially focus on human factors (such as human knowledge and human preference) and formal/symbolic methods in natural language processing. As a person with experience of humanities education, I am also interested in discussing philosophy, world history and Japnese.

Education
======
- M.S. in Computational Linguistics, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA, Aug 2023 - May 2025
